However, '-' used a lot in medical named entities, such as 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'whole-blood', therefore, I did not remove '-'. Otherwise it would have negative impact on the performance of NER and thus the following downstream tasks.\n",

Also, lemmatization and stemming works on token level, but there are named entities consist of multiple word tokens, and modified a token in a named entity phrase would affect the NER and the following downstream tasks.For example, 'lung kidney lymphatic vascular systems', 'lymphatic' will be stemmed to 'lymphat'.\n",
    "- I did not convert the text to BOW as the assignment spec 1.c said, because I will use scispacy to perform NER, which takes text as input. And also in the 'assignment tips' and assignment specification step 4 (d), we are encouraged to use word embeddings, so I am not using BOW to vectorise the text in this assignment."

    "In this section, I only processed the paper title, abstract and first 500 words and last 500 words of the body text, because these two parts of the body text can introduce and conclude this paper, which are more representative of the body text. (I tried to process the whole body_text previously, but my computer always froze and could not process all 10000 samples' whole body text, so I sub-sampled the body text to these two parts to represent the whole body text). The process pipeline consists of NER, abbrev resolution, and a further text normalisation using UMLS's concept id (cui). The detailed processing steps are as follows: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I utilized the library sciSpaCy 'en_core_sci_sm' pretrained model to perform Named Entity Recognition, and added extra pipeline ,entity_linker with abbreviation resolution, to link the recognized entity to the UMLS knowledge base, where the 'UMLS' stands for the Unified Medical Language System. The entity linker will link the entity to an external medical knowledge base. In this case, I used UMLS, which contains around 3M biomedical concepts. There are other options of the external knowledge base, such as MESH (Medical Subject Headings, 30K entities), but I am using the UMLS, because it is the largest medical knowledge base in SciSpaCy. In this step, the entity linker will map the recognised entity to the known entity (or concept) in th UMLS. This process will also resolve the abbreviations, by adding \"resolve_abbreviations\": True. Abbreviation resolution is an important step because abbreviations are commonly exist in biomedical texts. For each recognised entity, I will only link it to the top 1 match (by setting 'k':1), with a threshold of 0.8 (the default thresh is 0.7, but I tuned it up to 0.8, for a more fine-grained output).\n",
    "Once I match it to a concept entity in UMLS, then I keep its canonical name and other alias recorded in UMLS. If the entities are recognised but not the same as the UMLS canonical name nor any UMLS alias, then this entity name will be added to its alias list as well, and its UMLS canonical name will be the key of this entity entry in the KB. Therefore, during the construction of the KB, the number of entities is growing as the model scanning through the articles, and at the same time, each entities' aliases list are growing too. Furthermore, if the entity is already exist in the KB, its 'paper_lst' is also updated when scanning new articles."

    "The lack of medical vocabulary is the major drawback of using GloVe embedding in this assignment. However, using pretrained word embedding is asked in the assignment step 4(d). Therefore, I am still going to implement my IR system using GloVe. Furthermore, integrating the pre-trained word embedding into the Information Retrival System can generally improve the performance of the retrival, because TF-IDF cannot imply the semantic similarity, whereas, the pre-trained word embeddings learned the semantic meaning of the words over a large amount of text. Therefore, I am going to integrate GloVe into the IR System.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Potential Improvement: <br>\n",
    "1. It's better to use a word embedding that can capture more medical terms' meanings, instead of using general-purpose word embedding GloVe. I did some research on this and found a publically available biomedical word embedding 'cui2vec' (GitHub: https://github.com/beamandrew/cui2vec , download: https://figshare.com/s/00d69861786cd0156d81 , paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01486 ). 'cui2vec' can map UMLS concept unique identifier (cui) to a vector. This implies 'cui2vec' word embedding is highly aligned and consistent with our knowledge base that is built with UMLS concepts as well. However, 'cui2vec' does not cover a lot of the entity concepts that are in out CORD-19 article KB (only 32.43% available, which is even worse than GloVe. 'cui2vec' is in entity phrase levels, GloVe is in word token level, but generally speaking, 32.43% in entity level is worse than 44.63% in token level, because even there is one unknown word in a medical phrase, but if we can embed other tokens, the model can still contain partial information of this token). Other than 'cui2vec', there is an available 'BioWordVec'. 'BioWordVec' is a biomedical word embedding pre-trained on PubMed+MIMIC-III using FastText, but this embedding is too big (13GB) for my local computer. Therefore, I am going to use GloVe embedding, which can be used on my local PC, and also covers larger amount of medical terms compared with 'cui2vec'. However, if I have a computer with better computation power and bigger memory, I will definitely give 'BioWordVec' a try.\n",

    "2. Due to the lack of coverage of medical terminologies in GloVe embedding, I am going to use both TF-IDF and pre-trained GloVe word embeddings in my IR system. By combining these two scores, the retrival performance can be more robust, especially in the cases of out-of-vocabulary in GloVe. The detailed implementation of my IR system as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- query pre-processing:\n",
    "    - In my IR system, I pre-process the query by removing the stopwords. Then perform NER by using two models, one is 'en_core_sci_sm' for medical entity recognition, and 'en_core_web_sm' for general named entity recognition. This is because the SciSpaCy medical NER model are not good at recognising general entities, such as, author names, etc. Therefore, we also need a general NER model too.\n",
    "- matching common entities and get the posting list to reduce the paper search space:\n",
    "    - if the entity in the query is matched to a canonical name in the inverted index key, then we store this entity for further embedding and tf-idf computation, also get id of the articles mentioned this entity.\n",
    "    - if this entity in the query is an alias (other associated names) of a canonical name, then we will get its canonical name. Then do the same steps above.\n",
    "    - If query entity is neither a canonical name nor an alias, then I compute the cosine similarity of this query entity with all the canonical names in the inverted index. if all the similarities are < 0.7, it won't match to any doc canonical entities, and we will ignore this query entity. Otherwise, the query entity will match to the canonical name with the highest similarity score. (This text normalisation step can also be done with the scispacy UMLS entitylinker, but it's a very heavy model, and it is very time-consuming. Therefore, I am utilising the cosine similarity of the embedding to perform the soft match. Normalising the query text is important, because there will be query entities that are neither the canonical name nor the known aliases in the KB, but they might describe the same concept. Using cosine similarity to perform the soft match can mitigate this issue)\n",
    "    - Finally, the query will be represented by these matched entities, and at the same time we also obtained a reduced doc search space from inverted index method\n",
    "- Compute the score for all the doc in the reduced search space\n",
    "    - The score of the retrival rank contains two parts, the tf-idf and the cosine similarity of the query and document vectors\n",
    "        - The query and the document are both represented by their recognised entities. If an entity is composed of multiple word tokens, then this entity will be represented as a mean-pooling of all the tokens, therefore, all the entity embeddings are 300d (the dimension is the same as the GloVe embedding for a single token). Then the query embedding and the document embedding vector is the mean-pooling vector of all their recognised entities, so the query and the documents vectors are both 300d.\n",
    "        - To alleviate the limited medical vocabulary coverage of the GloVe embedding, I utilised both tf-idf and the GloVe embedding cosine similarity.\n",
    "        - I first standardise the embedding cosine similarity list and the tfidf list both in the range of 0-1. For each document I averaged its standardised tf-idf score and the standardised embedding cosine score, and this average will be the final score of ranking. By doing this, some rare medical words that are not in the GloVe embedding can still obtain some ranking score from tf-idf part. There are some out-of-vocabulary retrival test examples below.\n",
    "        - Finally, rank the documents based on the scores.\n",

    "How useful NER and KB for this task?\n",
    "- NER: With the help of NER, the number of unique words are significantly reduced and thus improved the time efficiency (without big drop of retrieval performance). Because the conventional IR using inverted index method is utilising all the unique words, which is not a desired method especially when the document collection is huge. After performing NER, the IR system can focus more on the context, so even we reduce the space of inverted index, the IR system can still maintain a good performance. Furthermore, using unique words will break the entity phrases apart, and twisted the representation of the original meaning. Therefore, we need NER to maintain the integrity of the context.\n",
    "- KB: The Knowledge base enable an easy implementation of the retrieval system by collecting all the crucial information of the document collection. In the KB, each document is represented as its entities, so people do not need to go through the entire text. The most important part of KB is the storage of canonical names and the associated aliases for text normalisation. In real life, the ways of conveying the same concept in natural language could be various. And text normalisation could enable the IR system to capture the concepts correctly under these variations."

      "BACKGROUND: Corona virus (COVID-19) is an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel corona virus and declared to be a global health emergency and a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Prevention strategies to control the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as closing of schools, refraining from gathering, and social distancing, have direct impacts on mental well-being. SARS-CoV-2 has a devastating psychological impact on the mental health status of the community and, particularly when associated with psychotic symptoms, it could affect the overall quality-of-life. The virus also has the potential to enter and infect the brain. As a result, psychosis symptoms could be an emerging phenomenon associated with the corona virus pandemic. The presence of psychotic symptoms may complicate the management options of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article review is to elaborate the relationships between COVID-19 and psychotic symptoms. METHODOLOGY: We independently searched different electronic databases, such as Google scholar, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and other relevant sources published in English globally, by using the search terms “psychosis and COVID-19”, “corona virus”, “brief psychotic”, “schizophrenia”, “organic psychosis”, “infectious disease”, “mental illness”, “pandemics”, and “psychiatry” in various permutations and combinations. RESULTS: The results of the included studies revealed that patients with a novel corona virus had psychotic symptoms, including hallucination in different forms of modality, delusion, disorganized speech, and grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviors. The patients with COVID-19-related psychotic symptoms had responded with a short-term administration of the antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: A corona virus-related psychosis has been identified in different nations, but it is difficult to conclude that a novel corona virus has been biologically related to psychosis or exacerbates psychotic symptoms. Therefore, to identify the causal relationships between COVID-19 and psychosis, the researchers should investigate the prospective study on the direct biological impacts of COVID-19 and psychosis, and the clinicians should pay attention for psychotic symptoms at the treatment center and isolation rooms in order to reduce the complication of a novel corona virus.\n",

      "Headache was reported in up to one‐third of the hospitalized patients; yet, the clinical characteristics of headache associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) have not been defined. This observational case study included patients who were consulted to headache unit due to headache and had COVID‐19 illness. Headache features in 13 PCR‐confirmed COVID‐19 patients with mild symptoms were reported. Headache was the isolated symptom of the COVID‐19 in 3 patients and emerged as an early symptom during the disease course in all patients. Patients specified severe, rapid onset, unrelenting headache with migraine‐like features, as well as unusual sensory symptoms such as anosmia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and loss of appetite and weight. Headache lasted up to 3 days in 70% of the patients and resolved in all patients within 2 weeks. Despite the fact that most of the patients were female and headache characteristics were suggestive of migraine, majority of patients were not suffering from primary headaches. It was concluded that headache could be an isolated symptom of COVID‐19, which might possibly be ignored in asymptomatic patients. Headaches associated with COVID‐19 included features resembling migraine and/or atypical symptoms including anosmia and diarrhea.\n",

      "The aim of the foregoing study was to assess whether physical activity during pregnancy affects the occurrence of anxiety and depression during pregnancy, postpartum and 6 months following childbirth. This study tried to answer the following questions: How was the incidence of depression and anxiety different in the pre- and postpartum periods? What intensity level of physical activity protects against the symptoms of anxiety and depression? Does the time spent engaged in sedentary activities and MVPA affect the occurrence of depression and anxiety before and after childbirth? The study group under analysis consisted of 187 women aged 19–41 years. The research was conducted between April 2016 and November 2020. The study was divided into four stages: T0—qualification to participate in the study; T1—medical history acquisition, consisting of a short questionnaire and two long questionnaires (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)), as well as an assessment of 7-day physical activity using Actigraph accelerometers during the pregnancy; T2—the completion of the EPDS and GAD-7 questionnaires after the birth; T3—the completion of the EPDS and GAD-7 questionnaire 6 months after giving birth. The obtained results were statistically processed in the Statistica 13.3 software package. A significance level of p < 0.05 was assumed. The highest percentage of depression occurred immediately after the delivery, followed by 6 months after delivery, and the smallest number of women suffered from depression before the birth (p < 0.001). The analysis of correlations of physical activity with anxiety symptoms did not show significant correlations. However, the situation is different in the case of depression symptoms. Women taking fewer steps before delivery showed a greater tendency to develop depressive symptoms before, immediately after and 6 months after the delivery (p < 0.001). Women who were less active (took fewer steps per day, spent less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical (MVPA) activities or spent more time being sedentary) showed symptoms of depression on the EPDS scale. It appeared that those with severe anxiety symptoms had the highest sedentary time scores before the delivery (p = 0.020). Reduced physical activity promotes the onset of postnatal depression, while being active reduces this risk. Interestingly, even light physical activity “protects” against the occurrence of depression and is better than sedentary activities. Such clear conclusions cannot be drawn in relation to anxiety symptoms. Sedentary behaviour may promote anxiety symptoms immediately after childbirth, but this study should be continued in order to confirm it during other time periods.\n"

Naturally, viruses must successfully interface with the robust cellular RNA degradation machinery to achieve an optimal balance between viral and cellular gene expression and establish a productive infection in the host. In the past several years, studies have discovered many elegant strategies that viruses have evolved to circumvent the cellular RNA degradation machinery, ranging from disarming the RNA decay pathways and co-opting the factors governing cellular mRNA stability to promoting host mRNA degradation that facilitates selective viral gene expression and alters the dynamics of host-pathogen interaction. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the multifaceted interaction between viruses and cellular mRNA degradation machinery to provide an insight into the regulatory mechanisms that influence gene expression in viral infections.\n",

      "Ribosomal recruitment of cellular mRNAs depends on binding of eIF4F to the mRNA’s 5′-terminal ‘cap’. The minimal ‘cap0’ consists of N7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide via a 5′-5′ triphosphate (ppp) bridge. Cap0 is further modified by 2′-O-methylation of the next two riboses, yielding ‘cap1’ (m7GpppNmN) and ‘cap2’ (m7GpppNmNm). However, some viral RNAs lack 2′-O-methylation, whereas others contain only ppp- at their 5′-end. Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed effectors of innate immunity that inhibit viral replication by incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we investigated the ability of IFIT family members to interact with cap1-, cap0- and 5′ppp- mRNAs and inhibit their translation. IFIT1 and IFIT1B showed very high affinity to cap-proximal regions of cap0-mRNAs (K(1/2,app) ∼9 to 23 nM). The 2′-O-methylation abrogated IFIT1/mRNA interaction, whereas IFIT1B retained the ability to bind cap1-mRNA, albeit with reduced affinity (K(1/2,app) ∼450 nM). The 5′-terminal regions of 5′ppp-mRNAs were recognized by IFIT5 (K(1/2,app) ∼400 nM). The activity of individual IFITs in inhibiting initiation on a specific mRNA was determined by their ability to interact with its 5′-terminal region: IFIT1 and IFIT1B efficiently outcompeted eIF4F and abrogated initiation on cap0-mRNAs, whereas inhibition on cap1- and 5′ppp- mRNAs by IFIT1B and IFIT5 was weaker and required higher protein concentrations.\n"

      "Background: Some but not all previous studies report that pneumonia in children aged less than five years is associated with lower lung function and elevated risk of respiratory disease. To date, none have explored these associations in at-risk populations such as First Nations Australians, whose incidence of early childhood pneumonia is among the highest reported in the world. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1276 First Nations Australian children/young adults aged 5–25 years recruited from regional/remote Queensland and Northern Territory communities and schools. Associations between pneumonia and both spirometry values and asthma were investigated using linear and logistic regression. Results: Early childhood pneumonia was associated with lower FEV1 and FVC Z-scores, but not FEV1/FVC% Z-scores, when occurring before age three (FEV1 β = −0.42, [95%CI −0.79, −0.04]; FVC β = −0.62, [95%CI −1.14, −0.09]), and between three and five years (β = −0.50, [95%CI −0.88, −0.12]; β = −0.63, [95%CI −1.17, −0.10]), compared to those who never had pneumonia. Similarly, pneumonia occurring when aged before age three years (OR = 3.68, 95%CI 1.96–6.93) and three to five years (OR = 4.81, 95%CI 1.46–15.8) was associated with increased risk of asthma in later childhood. Conclusions: Early childhood pneumonia is associated with lung function deficits and increased asthma risk in later childhood/early adulthood in First Nations Australians. The disproportionate impact of pneumonia on at-risk children must be addressed as a priority.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in December 2019 and has infected more than 80 million people worldwide, and more than 50 million people have achieved a clinical cure. In this study, the pulmonary function results of patients after clinical medicine for three months were reported. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of COVID-19 on lung function in patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 56 COVID-19-infected patients who were cured after the clinical treatment at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center in Zhejiang Province from January 31, 2020, to March 10, 2020. At discharge and three months after discharge, lung function was measured, including inspiratory vital capacity (IVC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in first second to inspiratory vital capacity (FEV1/IVC), maximum mid-expiratory flow rate (MEF), peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), and carbon monoxide dispersion (DLCO). RESULTS: At discharge, there were 37 patients (66.1%) with pulmonary dysfunction, 22 patients (39.3%) with ventilation dysfunction, 31 cases (55.4%) with small airway dysfunction, and 16 cases (28.6%) with restricted ventilation dysfunction combined with small airway dysfunction. At 3 months after discharge, 24 of the 56 patients still had pulmonary dysfunction and all of them had small airway dysfunction, of which 10 patients (17.9%) were restricted ventilation dysfunction combined with small airway dysfunction. DLCO was measured three months after discharge. Twenty-nine patients (51.8%) had mild to moderate diffuse dysfunction. All pulmonary function indexes of 56 patients recovered gradually after 3 months after release, except FEV1/IVC, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There were 41 patients of normal type (73.2%) and 15 patients of severe type (26.8%). Among the 15 severe patients, 8 patients (53.3%) had ventilation dysfunction at discharge, 9 patients (60%) had small airway dysfunction, 4 patients (26.7%) still had ventilation dysfunction 3 months after discharge, 7 patients (46.7%) had small airway dysfunction, and 10 patients (66.7%) had diffuse dysfunction. Among the 41 common type patients, 14 patients (34.1%) had ventilation dysfunction at discharge, 22 patients (53.7%) had small airway dysfunction, 6 patients (14.6%) still had ventilation dysfunction 3 months after discharge, 17 patients (41.5%) had small airway dysfunction, and 19 patients (46.3%) had diffuse dysfunction. Patients with severe COVID-19 had more pulmonary impairment and improved pulmonary function than normal patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection can cause lung function impairment, manifested as restricted ventilation dysfunction, small airway dysfunction, and diffuse dysfunction. The pulmonary function of most patients was improved 3 months after clinical cure and discharge, and some patients remained with mild to moderate diffuse dysfunction and small airway dysfunction.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) are leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. There is a well-known comorbidity between COPD and CAD, which is only partly explained by smoking and other known common risk factors. In order to better understand the relationship between COPD and CAD, we analyzed myocardial perfusion, pulmonary function and novel cardiovascular biomarkers in patients with symptoms suggesting myocardial ischemia. METHODS: A total of 396 subjects from the Swedish Biomarkers and Genetics CardioPulmonary Physiology Study (BiG CaPPS) were included, all of whom had been referred to myocardial perfusion imaging due to suspected myocardial ischemia. Subjects performed myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), pulmonary function tests (PFT) and analysis of 92 proteomic biomarkers, previously associated with cardiovascular disease. Linear regression was used to study the relationship between MPI and PFT results and proteomic biomarkers. RESULTS: Subjects with CAD (n = 159) had lower diffusing capacity (D(LCO)) than patients without CAD (6.64 versus 7.17 mmol/(min*kPa*l); p = 0.004) in models adjusted for common covariates such as smoking, but also diabetes and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The association remained significant after additional adjustment for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) (p = 0.009). Subjects with CAD, compared with subjects without CAD, had higher total airway resistance (0.37 vs 0.36 kPa/(l/s); p = 0.036). Among 92 protein biomarkers, nine were associated with a combined diagnosis of CAD and airflow obstruction: VSIG2, KIM1, FGF-23, REN, XCL1, GIF, ADM, TRAIL-R2 and PRSS8. SIGNIFICANCE: Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide is decreased in patients with CAD, independently of decreased FEV(1), diabetes, and elevated BNP. Several cardiovascular biomarkers are associated with co-existent CAD and airflow obstruction, but none with airflow obstruction only. The current findings indicate that the interaction between CAD and lung function is complex, including mechanisms beyond the known association between CAD and reduced ventilation.\n"

Therefore, the doc retrieved are more 'lung function' orientated, and less 'covid' oriented.

      "Cadmium (Cd) exposure is a widespread problem in many parts of the world, but effective means to treat Cd exposure is still lacking. Hence, an engineered strain expressing metallothionein (MT) named Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN)-MT was constructed, and its potential in the treatment of Cd exposure was evaluated. The in vitro studies showed that metallothionein expressed by EcN-MT could significantly bind Cd. Further, the in vivo results indicated that EcN-MT strain could reduce 26.3% Cd in the liver and increase 24.7% Cd in the feces, which greatly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increased catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in liver, and reduced the expression of toll-like receptor4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88) andincreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-Associated X (Bax). Moreover, high throughput sequencing results indicated that EcN-MT strain greatly enhanced the beneficial bacteria of Ruminococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Akkermansia, Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Dubosiella and restored the disturbed microbial ecology to the normal level. Therefore, the high Cd binding capacity of the expressed metallothionein, together with the beneficial characteristics of the host bacteria EcN, makes EcN-MT a sound reagent for the treatment of subchronic Cd exposure-induced liver injury.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The current corona virus pandemic is acting as a stressor or trauma, which not only threats physical health status, but also threats mental health status and well-being of people. Currently, COVID-19 pandemic is a life-threatening unpredictable condition accompanied with a large number of uncertainties. The present study has mainly aimed to assess mental health and the relevant social factors during this pandemic in Fars province. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 922 participants in Fars province, Iran, using internet-based data collection technique. All the included participants filled out the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Moreover, demographic variables and some social factors were evaluated by asking some questions. All the participants were ensured of the confidentiality of the collected data, and willingly completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants, there were 629 women (68.2%) and 293 men (31.2%). The mean age of the participants was 36.98 ± 11.08 years old. Four hundred twenty-five subjects (46.1%) obtained GHQ-28 scores above the cut-off point, and accordingly, they were suspected of having poor mental health statuses. Women, in comparison to men (OR = 2.034, 95%:1.62–3.28), and individuals aged < 50 years old, in comparison to those aged > 50 years old (OR: 4.01 95%:2.15–7.50), have poorer mental health statuses. Trusting on media, health authorities, and cooperation with policy makers, as well as having uncertainty on information about Coronavirus pandemic were also shown to be associated with poor mental health condition (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that the number of those people with suspected poor mental health in Fars province significantly increased compared to a previous study using the same questionnaire. Furthermore, the participants who had less trust in media and policymakers were more prone to mental health problems. Therefore, it can be concluded that supporting people in these life-threatening pandemic crises is of great importance, so the policy makers and media must present reliable and valid information to people as soon as possible.\n",

      "The lifestyle adopted by most people in Western societies has an important impact on the propensity to metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases). This is often accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation, driven by the activation of various molecular pathways such as STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), IKK (IκB kinase), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases), COX2 (cyclooxigenase 2), and NF-Kβ (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells). Multiple intervention studies have demonstrated that lifestyle changes can lead to reduced inflammation and improved health. This can be linked to the concept of real-life risk simulation, since humans are continuously exposed to dietary factors in small doses and complex combinations (e.g., polyphenols, fibers, polyunsaturated fatty acids, etc.). Inflammation biomarkers improve in patients who consume a certain amount of fiber per day; some even losing weight. Fasting in combination with calorie restriction modulates molecular mechanisms such as m-TOR, FOXO, NRF2, AMPK, and sirtuins, ultimately leads to significantly reduced inflammatory marker levels, as well as improved metabolic markers. Moving toward healthier dietary habits at the individual level and in publicly-funded institutions, such as schools or hospitals, could help improving public health, reducing healthcare costs and improving community resilience to epidemics (such as COVID-19), which predominantly affects individuals with metabolic diseases.\n"

      "INTRODUCTION: Decreased immunosuppression has been proposed for kidney transplant recipients infected with Covid-19 but the impact on the alloreactive immune response during and after infection has been poorly investigated. We assessed the occurrence of anti HLA donor specific antibodies (post-Covid DSA) and rejection episodes following Covid-19 with particular focus on immunosuppression modulation. METHODS: Kidney transplant recipients from two French institutions had anti-HLA antibody screening before and after Covid-19. Management of immunosuppression, rejection episodes, Covid-19 severity, inflammatory markers and antiviral therapies were recorded. RESULTS: From 251 recruited patients, 72 were excluded because of Covid-19 related death (n= 25) and incomplete immunological follow-up (n= 47). Among the remaining 179 included patients, almost half were hospitalized (49.2%). Antimetabolites were interrupted in 47% of patients (82% in hospitalized, median time of resumption of 23 days and in 15% non-hospitalized, median time of resumption of 7 days). Calcineurin inhibitors were interrupted in 12% of patients (all hospitalized, median time of resumption of 11 days). The incidence of post-Covid DSA was 4% (8% and 0% in hospitalized and non-hospitalized, respectively). Allograft rejection occurred in 3 patients (1.7%) and all were hospitalized. Younger age, transplantation less than one year and preexisting DSA were more frequently observed in post-Covid DSA positive patients, whereas inflammatory markers, lymphopenia and use of antiviral therapies were not. CONCLUSION: The incidence of post-Covid DSA among Covid-19 positive kidney transplant recipients was low (4%) despite a significant decrease in immunosuppression and was mainly restricted to high-risk immunological patient’s status. Covid-19 severity was not associated with post-Covid DSA and/or rejection.\n",

We can see the article is talking about lymph, antibodies and immune system.  The reason why IR can still retrive this relevant document is text normalisation is done with the help of knowledge base (knowledge base contained all named entities and their associated other names, e.g, 'lymphopenia' could be an alias of its canonical name) So, even if 'Lymphocytotoxic' is not in glove, the system can still use the tfidf of the canonical name of 'lymphopenia' and 'Lymphocytotoxic'. However, the second article retrieved is not relevant, but this does not affect the MRR metric, because we already got what we are seeking for in the first rank.

      "Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous photosynthetic microorganisms considered as important contributors to the formation of Earth’s atmosphere and to the process of nitrogen fixation. However, they are also frequently associated with toxic blooms, named cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs). This paper reports on an unusual out-of-season cyanoHAB and its dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Lake Avernus, South Italy. Fast detection strategy (FDS) was used to assess this phenomenon, through the integration of satellite imagery and biomolecular investigation of the environmental samples. Data obtained unveiled a widespread Microcystis sp. bloom in February 2020 (i.e., winter season in Italy), which completely disappeared at the end of the following COVID-19 lockdown, when almost all urban activities were suspended. Due to potential harmfulness of cyanoHABs, crude extracts from the “winter bloom” were evaluated for their cytotoxicity in two different human cell lines, namely normal dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). The chloroform extract was shown to exert the highest cytotoxic activity, which has been correlated to the presence of cyanotoxins, i.e., microcystins, micropeptins, anabaenopeptins, and aeruginopeptins, detected by molecular networking analysis of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data.\n",

      "There is a large assessment and treatment gap in child and adolescent mental health services, prominently so in low- and middle-income countries, where 90% of the world’s children live. There is an urgent need to find evidence-based interventions that can be implemented successfully in these low-resource contexts. This pre-pilot study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators to implementation as well as overall feasibility of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) in South Africa. A reflective and consensus building workshop was used to gather South African PCIT therapist (N = 4) perspectives on barriers, facilitators, and next steps to implementation in that country. Caregiver participants (N = 7) receiving the intervention in South Africa for the first time were also recruited to gather information on overall feasibility. Facilitators for implementation, including its strong evidence base, manualisation, and training model were described. Barriers relating to sustainability and scalability were highlighted. Largely positive views on acceptability from caregiver participants also indicated the promise of PCIT as an intervention in South Africa. Pilot data on the efficacy of the treatment for participating families are a next step. These initial results are positive, though research on how implementation factors contribute to the longer-term successful dissemination of PCIT in complex, heterogeneous low-resource settings is required.\n",

      "Many viruses alter intracellular calcium homeostasis. The rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane glycoprotein, increases intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis. However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca(2+)]cyto are unknown. We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release. Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic α-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster. The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity. In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca(2+) by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca(2+)]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells. When [Ca(2+)]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels. NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca(2+)]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus replication and virion assembly.\n",

      "High income countries (HIC) have set the initial global policy responses to COVID-19. Yet, low and middle income countries (LIMIC) face very different challenges than HIC. In LMIC, there is a far greater emphasis on community solutions; families live in far more dense communities, making shelter-in-place mandates questionable; and strengthening existing health systems is more important than novel services. LMIC have far fewer economic resources. Most distressing, the successful economic commitments that HIC made to help stop HIV in LMIC have not yet been imitated, or even initiated—this support is needed now to fight COVID-19.\n",

      "Artemisia annua is a medicinal plant particularly known for the production of a sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin; a specialty metabolite known for its efficacy in the treatment of malaria by killing different strains of Plasmodium falciparum due to radicals released upon the cleavage of its endoperoxide motif. Considering these facts and the immense medicinal value of artemisinin, the enhancement of in planta production of artemisinin is highly desirable. As strigolactones are known to regulate various aspects of plant growth and development, the effects of foliar spray of different concentrations of synthetic strigolactone analog GR24 (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 µM) on A. annua were studied. As compared to the control group, the foliar application of GR24 had a positive impact on general growth, photosynthesis, and other physiological indices with 4 µM GR24 showing the best results. The results indicate that GR24 application increased the plant biomass and various attributes related to photosynthesis, like total chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal conductance, internal CO(2,) and net photosynthetic rate. Moreover, the activity of various enzymes related to photosynthesis like carbonic anhydrase, nitrate reductase, and RuBisCO was escalated. The GR24 also improved certain attributes related to glandular trichomes, with a significant enhancement in content and yield of artemisinin as compared to untreated plants.\n",

      "Serological testing to evaluate antigen-specific antibodies in plasma is generally performed by rapid lateral flow test strips that lack quantitative results or by high complexity immunoassays that are time- and labor-intensive but provide semi-quantitative results. Here, we describe a novel application of biolayer interferometry for the rapid detection of antigen-specific antibody levels in plasma samples, and demonstrate its utility for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Our biolayer interferometry immunosorbent assay (BLI-ISA) utilizes single-use biosensors in an automated “dip-and-read” format, providing real-time optical measurements of antigen loading, plasma antibody binding, and antibody isotype detection. Complete semi-quantitative results are obtained in less than 20 min. BLI-ISA meets or exceeds the performance of high complexity methods such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Chemiluminescent Immunoassay. Importantly, our method can be immediately implemented on existing BLI platforms for urgent COVID-19 studies, such as serosurveillance and the evaluation of vaccine candidates. In a broader sense, BLI-ISA can be developed as a novel diagnostic platform to evaluate antibodies and other biomolecules in clinical specimens.\n",

      "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has lead to high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, has been causing major public health concerns since first detected in late 2019. Following identification of novel pathogens, questions in relation to dissemination of the pathogen and transmission routes begin to emerge. This rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in both faecal and wastewater samples across the globe, highlighting the potential for faecal-oral transmission of the virus. As a result, concerns regarding the transmission of the virus in the environment and the risk associated with contracting the virus in recreational waters, particularly where inadequately treated wastewater is discharged, have been emerging in recent weeks. This paper highlights the need for further research to be carried out to investigate the presence, infectivity and viability of this newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater effluent and receiving recreational waters.\n",

      "MS is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by demyelination, axonal damage and neurologic disability. The primary cause of this CNS disease remains elusive. Here we will address our current understanding of the role of viruses as potential environmental triggers for MS. Virus infections can act peripherally (outside the CNS) or within the CNS. The association of viral infections with demyelinating disease, in both animals and humans, will be discussed, as will the potential contributions of peripheral infection with Torque Teno virus, infection outside of and/or within the CNS with Epstein-Barr virus and infection within the CNS with Human Herpesvirus 6 to MS. An experimental animal model, Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible strains of mice is an example of viral infections of the CNS as a prerequisite for demyelination. Finally, the proposition that multiple virus infections, which first prime the immune system and then trigger the disease, as a model where infections outside of the CNS lead to inflammatory changes within the CNS, are required for the development of a MS-like disease is explored.\n",

      "Pandemic literature (and there is a sprawling canon of it) tells us much about the past so that we can learn for our future, but we have been poor students. We should have been better prepared for Covid-19, and even merely scratching the surface of pandemic literature by examining Albert Camus’s The Plague and Phillip Roth’s Nemesis is very revealing. Despite the remarkable heterogeneity of our world, there are some things about disease that are shared globally, and many things that are recorded in literature are pertinent to the current pandemic situation. Remembering past pandemics is vital to dealing with future ones. This article argues that documentation of pandemics offers important reminders of epidemiology but also about how race, class, gender, and sexuality are involved both in the representation and in the movement of disease. Fiction gives us the chance to revise our thinking both about our relationship with microbes and about how we imagine a balance between individual liberties and social responsibility. These matters seemed to many of us entirely novel concerns brought out by the novel coronavirus. In reality, they are not novel and have long been the concerns of pandemic literature. There are great dangers in forgetting this.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The current corona virus pandemic is acting as a stressor or trauma, which not only threats physical health status, but also threats mental health status and well-being of people. Currently, COVID-19 pandemic is a life-threatening unpredictable condition accompanied with a large number of uncertainties. The present study has mainly aimed to assess mental health and the relevant social factors during this pandemic in Fars province. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 922 participants in Fars province, Iran, using internet-based data collection technique. All the included participants filled out the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Moreover, demographic variables and some social factors were evaluated by asking some questions. All the participants were ensured of the confidentiality of the collected data, and willingly completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants, there were 629 women (68.2%) and 293 men (31.2%). The mean age of the participants was 36.98 ± 11.08 years old. Four hundred twenty-five subjects (46.1%) obtained GHQ-28 scores above the cut-off point, and accordingly, they were suspected of having poor mental health statuses. Women, in comparison to men (OR = 2.034, 95%:1.62–3.28), and individuals aged < 50 years old, in comparison to those aged > 50 years old (OR: 4.01 95%:2.15–7.50), have poorer mental health statuses. Trusting on media, health authorities, and cooperation with policy makers, as well as having uncertainty on information about Coronavirus pandemic were also shown to be associated with poor mental health condition (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that the number of those people with suspected poor mental health in Fars province significantly increased compared to a previous study using the same questionnaire. Furthermore, the participants who had less trust in media and policymakers were more prone to mental health problems. Therefore, it can be concluded that supporting people in these life-threatening pandemic crises is of great importance, so the policy makers and media must present reliable and valid information to people as soon as possible.\n",

      "Rules determine how team sport matches occur. Match-induced fatigue is specific to each sport, and may be associated with injury incidence. For example, the injury rate in soccer is distinctly higher during matches than in training sessions. Understanding the differences between team sports rules might be useful for enhancing rules (e.g., safer sport). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of the rule-induced physical demands between soccer, futsal, basketball, and handball, focusing on substitution rules. Data from the elite team sports’ rules (e.g., absolute and relative court dimensions; the number of players, substitutions allowed, total game time, time-outs) were collected, including the changes due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in soccer substitutions, and comparisons were performed. The data showed that soccer has higher rule-induced physical demands: e.g., substantially lower substitution rate, higher dimensions in absolute (eight to fifteen times), and relative (four to eight times) values. Simulations also showed that soccer has extremely large differences, even considering COVID-19 substitution changes (from three to up to five). We conclude that elite soccer has remarkably higher overall rule-induced physical demands than elite futsal, basketball and handball, and increasing soccer substitutions permanently (e.g., unlimited) might mitigate overall soccer demands.\n",

      "Aims: To report potential vaccine-induced ocular adverse events following inactivated COVID-19 vaccination (Sinopharm and Sinovac). Methods: This case series took place at a tertiary referral center in the southeast of China (Xiamen Eye Center in Fujian Province) from February 2021 to July 2021. Patients who received the first dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine and developed vaccine-related ocular adverse events within 10 days were included. The diagnosis of vaccine-related ocular adverse events was guided by the World Health Organization causality assessment and the Naranjo criteria. Results: Ten eyes of seven patients (two male individuals) presenting with ocular complaints following COVID-19 vaccine were included in the study. The mean (SD) age was 41.4 (9.3) years (range, 30–55 years). The mean time of ocular adverse event manifestations was 4.9 days (range, 1–10 days). Three patients were diagnosed with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH)-like uveitis, one with multifocal choroiditis, one with episcleritis, one with iritis, and one with acute idiopathic maculopathy. Two patients received the second dose of vaccine. One patient had exacerbation of VKH, and one patient had no symptoms. An aqueous humor analysis in three patients revealed elevated proinflammatory cytokines and negative virus copy. All the patients had transient ocular disturbance and responded well to steroids. No recurrence was noted during 6 months of follow-up. Conclusions: Potential ocular adverse events should be reported to increase the awareness of the health community for timely detection and proper treatment.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess satisfaction with telehealth interventions for a large nonprofit organization that transitioned interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to telehealth during a pandemic. Services provided via telehealth included applied behavior analysis (ABA), speech and language, and occupational therapies. A secondary survey evaluated reasons for declining telehealth services. METHODS: A survey was administered to 10,567 families who were receiving autism interventions. A total of 440 respondents answered all the questions on the survey, and their results were included in this study. A secondary survey was administered to 223 individuals who declined to have telehealth autism interventions. RESULTS: There was not a clinically meaningful difference in satisfaction across service types. Although all ratings were in the high range, caregivers ranked speech therapists as more dependable than ABA therapists, and this difference was statistically significant. The findings suggested that the majority of caregivers were generally satisfied with services provided in a telehealth format. For those who declined services, the majority indicated a discomfort with the use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: The participants of telehealth autism interventions reported high general satisfaction and indicated an improvement in their quality of life. Results provide suggestive evidence that increased satisfaction of telehealth services may allow for further acceptability and access for participants. Future research should evaluate participant and clinician satisfaction with telehealth versus in-person interventions.\n",

      "The unprecedented COVID‐19 crisis presents an imperative for mental health care systems to make digital mental health interventions a routine part of care. Already because of COVID‐19, many therapists have rapidly moved to using telehealth in place of in‐person contact. In response to this shift, Waller and colleagues compiled a series of expert recommendations to help clinicians pivot to delivering teletherapy to address eating disorders during COVID‐19. However, numerous barriers still impede widespread adoption and implementation of digital interventions. In this commentary, we aim to extend the recommendations for clinicians offered by Waller and colleagues by presenting a roadmap of the systems‐ and policy‐level requirements that are needed. We advocate for addressing barriers associated with training, licensing, safety, privacy, payment, and evaluation, as these factors have greatly limited use of these promising interventions. We also indicate that longer‐term goals should include introducing truly innovative digital mental health practices, such as stepped‐care models and simultaneously providing preventive and self‐management services in addition to clinical services, into the health care system. Now is the time to catalyze change and comprehensively address the barriers that have prevented widespread delivery of these efficacious digital services to the millions of people who would benefit.\n",

      "Many viruses alter intracellular calcium homeostasis. The rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane glycoprotein, increases intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis. However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca(2+)]cyto are unknown. We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release. Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic α-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster. The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity. In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca(2+) by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca(2+)]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells. When [Ca(2+)]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels. NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca(2+)]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus replication and virion assembly.\n",

      "As opportunistic pathogens, viruses have evolved many elegant strategies to manipulate host cells for infectious entry and replication. Viral apoptotic mimicry, defined by the exposure of phosphatidylserine — a marker for apoptosis — on the pathogen surface, is emerging as a common theme used by enveloped viruses to promote infection. Focusing on the four best described examples (vaccinia virus, dengue virus, Ebola virus and pseudotyped lentivirus), we summarize our current understanding of apoptotic mimicry as a mechanism for virus entry, binding and immune evasion. We also describe recent examples of non-enveloped viruses that use this mimicry strategy, and discuss future directions and how viral apoptotic mimicry could be targeted therapeutically.

      "INTRODUCTION: As researchers and academics around the world scramble ahead to dissect and analyse every aspect of the SARS-CoV2 virus, one such study explored the various underlying electrolyte abnormalities that were precipitated in patients suffering from a confirmed COVID-19 infection. A significant proportion of such patients were noted to be hypokalemic. Hypokalemia can be life threatening as it is known to cause cardiac arrhythmia. CASE PRESENTATION: Our encounter with said presentation was incidental. The on-call medical team was involved in a cardiac arrest call for a 74-year -old gentleman who developed torsades de pointes, Retrospective analysis of the clinical picture pointed out the fact that he was found to be persistently hypokalemic and bradycardic solely triggered as a result of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Although initially thought to be a pulmonary disease but along with time extra-pulmonary manifestations of Covid-19 has demonstrated significant consequences. Electrolyte abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction are examples of such extra-pulmonary pathologies. Therefore, it is important to keep close monitoring for such abnormalities otherwise could lead into life threatening arrythmias.\n",

      "Further development of the bioeconomy, the substitution of bioresources for fossil resources, will lead to an increased pressure on land and water resources in both agriculture and forestry. It is important to study whether resultant changes in land management may in turn lead to impairment of water services. This paper describes the Nordic Bioeconomy Pathways (NBPs), a set of regional sectoral storylines nested within the global Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) framework developed to provide the BIOWATER research program with land management scenarios for projecting future developments to explore possible conflicts between land management changes and the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The NBPs are a set of narrative storylines capturing a range of plausible future trajectories for the Nordic bioeconomy until 2050 and that are fit for use within hydrological catchment modelling, ecosystem service studies and stakeholder dialogue about possible changes in agricultural and forestry management practices.\n",

      "Type I IFN production is one of the hallmarks of host innate immune responses upon virus infection. Whilst most respiratory viruses carry IFN antagonists, reports on human metapneumovirus (HMPV) have been conflicting. Using deep sequencing, we have demonstrated that HMPV particles accumulate excessive amounts of defective interfering RNA (DIs) rapidly upon in vitro passage, and that these are associated with IFN induction. Importantly, the DIs were edited extensively; up to 70 % of the original A and T residues had mutated to G or C, respectively. Such high editing rates of viral RNA have not, to our knowledge, been reported before. Bioinformatics and PCR assays indicated that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) was the most likely editing enzyme. HMPV thus has an unusually high propensity to generate DIs, which are edited at an unprecedented high frequency. The conflicting published data on HMPV IFN induction and antagonism are probably explained by DIs in virus stocks. The interaction of HMPV DIs with the RNA-editing machinery and IFN responses warrants further investigation.\n",

      "Artemisia annua is a medicinal plant particularly known for the production of a sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin; a specialty metabolite known for its efficacy in the treatment of malaria by killing different strains of Plasmodium falciparum due to radicals released upon the cleavage of its endoperoxide motif. Considering these facts and the immense medicinal value of artemisinin, the enhancement of in planta production of artemisinin is highly desirable. As strigolactones are known to regulate various aspects of plant growth and development, the effects of foliar spray of different concentrations of synthetic strigolactone analog GR24 (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 µM) on A. annua were studied. As compared to the control group, the foliar application of GR24 had a positive impact on general growth, photosynthesis, and other physiological indices with 4 µM GR24 showing the best results. The results indicate that GR24 application increased the plant biomass and various attributes related to photosynthesis, like total chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal conductance, internal CO(2,) and net photosynthetic rate. Moreover, the activity of various enzymes related to photosynthesis like carbonic anhydrase, nitrate reductase, and RuBisCO was escalated. The GR24 also improved certain attributes related to glandular trichomes, with a significant enhancement in content and yield of artemisinin as compared to untreated plants.\n",

This study aimed to investigate the physiology and quality of M. crystallinum L. grown under different salinities and salt-priming conditions. All plants were first grown in 10% artificial seawater (ASW) for 10 days. After that, some plants remained in 10% ASW while the others were transferred to 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% ASW for another 10 days. Some plants also underwent a salt priming by transferring them gradually from 10% to 100% ASW over a span of 10 days (defined as salt primed). All plants were green and healthy. However, there were reductions in shoot and root productivity, leaf growth, and water content, but also an increase in leaf succulence after transferring plants to higher salinities. The salt-primed plants showed higher photosynthetic light use efficiency with higher chlorophyll concentration compared to other plants. The concentrations of proline, ascorbic acid (ASC), and total phenolic compounds (TPC) increased as percentages of ASW increased. The salt-primed plants switched from C(3) to crassulacean acid metabolism photosynthesis and accumulated the greatest amounts of proline, ASC, and TPC. In conclusion, higher salinities and salt priming enhance the nutritional quality of M. crystallinum L. but compromises productivity.\n",

      "COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus is an important step towards containing the virus spread. Although viral detection using molecular diagnostic methods is quite common and efficient, these methods are prone to errors, laborious and time consuming. There is an urgent need for blood-based tests which are simple to use, accurate, less time consuming, portable and cost-effective. Human blood plasma contains water, proteins, organic and in-organic substances including bacteria and viruses. Blood plasma can be effectively used to detect COVID-19 antibodies. The immune system generates antibodies (IgM/IgG proteins) in response to the virus and identification of these antibodies is related to the presence of the infection in the patient in the past. Therefore, detecting and testing the presence of these antibodies will be extremely useful for monitoring and surveillance of the population (Petherick, Lancet 395:1101–1102, 2020). Herein, we describe and propose a microfluidic ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) system to detect COVID-19 antibodies on a lab-on-chip platform. We propose to first separate plasma from whole human blood using a microfluidic device and subsequently perform the detection of antibodies in the separated plasma using a semi-automated on-chip ELISA.\n",

      "In this work, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based immunosensor was prepared by the immobilization of the amine-functionalized gold nanoparticles (N-AuNPs) on the sensing surface to sense immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in the aqueous solution and artificial plasma. The characterization studies of SPR based immunosensor for IgM detection were performed with scanning electron microscope (SEM), contact angle measurements, and ellipsometry. Kinetic studies for the IgM immunosensor were carried out in the range of 1.0 to 200 ng/mL IgM concentrations in an aqueous solution. The total IgM analysis time including adsorption, desorption, and regeneration cycles was nearly 10 min for the prepared immunosensor. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were found as 0.08 and 0.26 ng/mL, respectively. The reusability of the proposed immunosensor was tested with 6 consecutive adsorption-desorption, and regeneration cycles. Also, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was utilized in the validation of the immunosensor.\n",

      "Immune checkpoints play important roles in immune regulation, and blocking immune checkpoints on the cell membrane is a promising strategy in the treatment of cancer. Based on this, monoclonal antibodies are having much rapid development, such as those against CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1).But the cost of preparation of monoclonal antibodies is too high and the therapeutic effect is still under restrictions. Recently, a series of soluble immune checkpoints have been found such as sCTLA-4 (soluble CTLA-4) and sPD-1 (soluble PD-1). They are functional parts of membrane immune checkpoints produced in different ways and can be secreted by immune cells. Moreover, these soluble checkpoints can diffuse in the serum. Much evidence has demonstrated that these soluble checkpoints are involved in positive or negative immune regulation and that changes in their plasma levels affect the development, prognosis and treatment of cancer. Since they are endogenous molecules, they will not induce immunological rejection in human beings, which might make up for the deficiencies of monoclonal antibodies and enhance the utility value of these molecules. Therefore, there is an increasing need for investigating novel soluble checkpoints and their functions, and it is promising to develop relevant therapies in the future. In this review, we describe the production mechanisms and functions of various soluble immune checkpoint receptors and ligands and discuss their biological significance in regard to biomarkers, potential candidate drugs, therapeutic targets, and other topics.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The current corona virus pandemic is acting as a stressor or trauma, which not only threats physical health status, but also threats mental health status and well-being of people. Currently, COVID-19 pandemic is a life-threatening unpredictable condition accompanied with a large number of uncertainties. The present study has mainly aimed to assess mental health and the relevant social factors during this pandemic in Fars province. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 922 participants in Fars province, Iran, using internet-based data collection technique. All the included participants filled out the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Moreover, demographic variables and some social factors were evaluated by asking some questions. All the participants were ensured of the confidentiality of the collected data, and willingly completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants, there were 629 women (68.2%) and 293 men (31.2%). The mean age of the participants was 36.98 ± 11.08 years old. Four hundred twenty-five subjects (46.1%) obtained GHQ-28 scores above the cut-off point, and accordingly, they were suspected of having poor mental health statuses. Women, in comparison to men (OR = 2.034, 95%:1.62–3.28), and individuals aged < 50 years old, in comparison to those aged > 50 years old (OR: 4.01 95%:2.15–7.50), have poorer mental health statuses. Trusting on media, health authorities, and cooperation with policy makers, as well as having uncertainty on information about Coronavirus pandemic were also shown to be associated with poor mental health condition (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that the number of those people with suspected poor mental health in Fars province significantly increased compared to a previous study using the same questionnaire. Furthermore, the participants who had less trust in media and policymakers were more prone to mental health problems. Therefore, it can be concluded that supporting people in these life-threatening pandemic crises is of great importance, so the policy makers and media must present reliable and valid information to people as soon as possible.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic required the rapid conversion of medical school curricula to virtual instruction. Prior to the crisis, histopathology teaching laboratories at UT Health San Antonio included completion of an Individual Laboratory Quiz before the laboratory session, a Team Application Exercise released and completed during the laboratory session with guidance from faculty, and a graded Team Laboratory Quiz at the end of the laboratory session. Adaptation of this interactive, in-person activity to a fully online platform included releasing the Team Application Exercise earlier to provide ample time for students to work virtually with their teams, conducting laboratory sessions using Microsoft Teams, with 5 to 6 teams led by a single instructor, and requiring the Team Laboratory Quiz to be taken individually for ensuring quiz security and test integrity. For incentivizing collaboration while completing the Team Application Exercise, the final score was either the student’s individual score on the Team Laboratory Quiz or their team’s average, whichever was higher. Comparison of student scores on the modified Team Laboratory Quiz to Team Laboratory Quiz scores using the earlier laboratory format prior to COVID-19 showed a significant decline; however, scores on other weekly quizzes or examinations were unaffected. Students welcomed the early release of Team Application Exercise and easier access to faculty but indicated that the modified Team Laboratory Quiz decreased peer-teaching and learning experience and increased anxiety. Faculty indicated the loss of personal interaction with students as a major theme. These data suggest that novel pedagogical approaches are required for online histopathology instruction to accommodate differences in learning styles while maintaining the benefits of team collaboration.\n",

      "Matrix proteins are encoded by many enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, herpes viruses, and coronaviruses. Underneath the viral envelope of influenza virus, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms an oligomeric layer critical for particle stability and pH-dependent RNA genome release. However, high-resolution structures of full-length monomeric M1 and the matrix layer have not been available, impeding antiviral targeting and understanding of the pH-dependent transitions involved in cell entry. Here, purification and extensive mutagenesis revealed protein–protein interfaces required for the formation of multilayered helical M1 oligomers similar to those observed in virions exposed to the low pH of cell entry. However, single-layered helical oligomers with biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those found in infectious virions before cell entry were observed upon mutation of a single amino acid. The highly ordered structure of the single-layered oligomers and their likeness to the matrix layer of intact virions prompted structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resulting 3.4-Å–resolution structure revealed the molecular details of M1 folding and its organization within the single-shelled matrix. The solution of the full-length M1 structure, the identification of critical assembly interfaces, and the development of M1 assembly assays with purified proteins are crucial advances for antiviral targeting of influenza viruses.\n",

      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: China is a typical sexual conservative cultural context country; it is necessary to understand the problematic pornography use (PPU) in China, which may reflect the influence of the conservative culture on PPU. In this review, the pornography use motivation, prevalence, screening scales, diagnosing elements, and intervention situation in China were described. RECENT FINDINGS: The most preponderant pornography use motivations were self-exploration and seeking education. In line with the international situation in screening PPU, inconsistent assessment resulted in fluctuant prevalence in China. Fortunately, several screening scales were confirmed valid in Chinese sample. The symptoms of PPU among Chinese were similar with samples from other Western countries. More urgently, in China, it appeared there exists a supply–demand imbalance in regards to the prevalence of PPU and the limited treatment options available. SUMMARY: Due to the conservative attitude toward sex and pornography, research on pornography use in China is scarce. The Chinese pornography motivations differ from the Western more permissive countries, but the core symptoms of PPU among Chinese are similar with the other Western participants. Actually, in the Chinese public, the prevalence of PPU is high; however, the demand for professional psychotherapy services exceeds the current available resources.\n",

      "The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is particularly virulent in the elderly while children are largely spared. Here, we explored the potential role of cross-reactive immunity acquired from pediatric vaccinations and exposure to common human pathogens in the protection and pathology of COVID-19. To that end, we sought for peptide matches to SARS-CoV-2 (identity ≥ 80%, in at least eight residues) in the proteomes of 25 human pathogens and in vaccine antigens, and subsequently predicted their T and B cell reactivity to identify potential cross-reactive epitopes. We found that viruses subject to pediatric vaccinations do not contain cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2, precluding that they can provide any general protection against COVID-19. Likewise, common viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and several herpesviruses are also poor or null sources of cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, discarding that immunological memory against these viruses can have any general protective or pathological role in COVID-19. In contrast, we found combination vaccines for treating diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis infectious diseases (DTP vaccine) to be significant sources of potential cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. DTP cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2 include numerous CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes with broad population protection coverage and potentially neutralizing B cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Worldwide, children receive several DTP vaccinations, including three-four doses the first year of life and one at 4–6 years of age. Moreover, a low antigenic Tdap dose is also given at ages 9–14. Thereby, children may well be protected from SARS-CoV-2 through cross-reactive immunity elicited by DTP vaccinations, supporting testing in the general population to prevent COVID-19.\n",

      "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting provides a mechanism to decode information located in two overlapping reading frames by diverting a proportion of translating ribosomes into a second open reading frame (ORF). The result is the production of two proteins: the product of standard translation from ORF1 and an ORF1–ORF2 fusion protein. Such programmed frameshifting is commonly utilized as a gene expression mechanism in viruses that infect eukaryotic cells and in a subset of cellular genes. RNA secondary structures, consisting of pseudoknots or stem–loops, located downstream of the shift site often act as cis-stimulators of frameshifting. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that antisense oligonucleotides can functionally mimic these RNA structures to induce +1 ribosomal frameshifting when annealed downstream of the frameshift site, UCC UGA. Antisense-induced shifting of the ribosome into the +1 reading frame is highly efficient in both rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions and in cultured mammalian cells. The efficiency of antisense-induced frameshifting at this site is responsive to the sequence context 5′ of the shift site and to polyamine levels.\n",

In this commentary we discuss how COVID-19 has demonstrated the limited usefulness and possible harms of routine UDT. We propose that practitioners should stop using routine UDT and instead use targeted UDT, paired with clinical reasoning, as part of a patient-centered approach to care.\n",

      "With the continuing rise of SARS-CoV2 infection globally and the emergence of various waves in different countries, understanding characteristics of susceptibility to infection, clinical severity, and outcomes remain vital. In this retrospective study, data was extracted for 39,539 patients from the de-identified Mount Sinai Health System COVID-19 database. We assessed the risk of mortality based on the presence of comorbidities and organ-specific sequelae in 7,032 CoV2 positive (+) patients. Prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities was high among SARS-CoV2+ individuals. Diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure all increased overall mortality risk, while asthma did not. Ethnicity modified the risk of mortality associated with these comorbidities. With regards to secondary complications in the setting of infection, individuals with acute kidney injury and acute myocardial injury showed an increase in mortality risk. Cerebral infarcts and acute venous thromboembolic events were not associated with increased risk of mortality. Biomarkers for cardiovascular injury, coagulation, and inflammation were compared between deceased and survived individuals. We found that cardiac and coagulation biomarkers were elevated and fell beyond normal range more often in deceased patients. Several, but not all, inflammatory markers evaluated were increased in deceased patients. In summary, we identified comorbidities and sequelae along with peripheral blood biomarkers that were associated with elevated clinical severity and poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Overall, these findings detail the granularity of previously reported factors which may impact susceptibility, clinical severity, and mortality during the course of COVID-19 disease.\n",

      "This research aimed to quantify the racial disparities of COVID-19 for primarily positive tests and deaths across the US and territories individually and collectively. The first research hypothesis investigated whether positive cases and death rates were higher for people of color (POC) than the White ethnic group. The second hypothesis examined whether there is a significant difference in confirmed positive cases and death rates between ethnic groups across the US and territories. The third hypothesis investigated if political party control and governmental policies affected the number of cases and death proportion rates across ethnic groups. The research findings suggest that POC positive cases and death rates were higher in some states. Black ethnic groups were dying at a high rate in the southeastern states, the District of Columbia, and in Maryland. Specifically, in the District of Columbia, the death rate is five times higher than the White ethnic group. For Latinx ethnic groups, the high cases and death rates have mostly occurred in western states, including Texas. The Latinx ethnic group accounted for half the total deaths in Texas and California. The Latinx ethnic group death rate is higher than the White ethnic group in four states: Texas, California, New Mexico, and the District of Columbia. The research findings also show that the rate of deaths and cases per ethnic group for policies and political factors were significant except for the mask mandate policy. Based on the analyzed data, mask mandates were not a factor in the cases or death rates of any ethnic group. Each state’s policies for bars, curfews, public schools, and travel—along with legislative party control—had the most influences across ethnic groups. The research results for the death rates and number of cases due to these implemented policies varied between ethnic groups.\n",

      "Fear of COVID-19 may make the imminence of death prescient for undergraduate students, increasing death anxiety and worsening mental health. Formal death education may provide benefits such as reduced fear of COVID-19 and death anxiety, and improved mental health. In this study, 86 undergraduate students completed a pre- and post-semester online questionnaire on fear of COVID-19, death anxiety, and mental health outcomes. Findings indicate indirect effects of death anxiety on fear of COVID-19 to anxiety. Moreover, fear of COVID-19, individual concerns about death, and death anxiety were reduced over the semester for undergraduate students in formal death education.\n",
