# A3

1. choose Op1/Op1, depends on which one has available code
2. Each person, do a benchmark, and write pseudo methodology in Overleaf (like dot points)
3. Unify a clean sub-dataset, (we all used different sampled subset)
4. Each person work on their own ipynb, and merge at the end.
5. before settle down our method, MUST check with the rest of the group members (1. check whether the method meet the requirement of the assignment. 2. avoiding differernt people implementing the same code)


To-DO: 
1. Settle doen topic before, 27th, next monday
